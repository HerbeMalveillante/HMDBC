# Herbe Malveillante Discord Bot Client

Herbe Malveillante Discord Bot Client is a program designed to save Discord servers, entirely or partly to have access to all the messages sent, locally.
The user must enter the token of a bot present on the server he wants to save.

# How to use : 

1) If you don't have it already, create a Discord bot, invite it on the server you want to save and get his Token (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html).
2) Make sure the bots have the permission to access all the channels you want to save, and can access messages history as well as read messages.
3) Launch the 'HMDBC.py' file. Enter the token of the bot you want to use.
4) The program will connect you and display the list of all the servers your bot have access to. Type the number corresponding to the number of the server you want to save and hit enter.
5) The program will display the list of channels your bot have access to. Type the indexes of the channels you want to save (press ENTER between each input), or type 'all' to select all the channels. Type 'end' and hit enter when you're done selecting the channels.
6) The program will now start saving the server. It may take a while, depending on the amount of messages the server contains. It may be a bad idea to download a Huge server that exists for years. PDF format is not made to store a large amount of pages and a document bigger than 10 000 pages could be corrupted easily.
Please note that a future version may solve this problem by optimizing the number of messages displayed in a page, very low at this moment.
7) Once the saving is complete (It may take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of the server you want to save.), you can retrieve the files in the location indicated by the program.

Thanks for using my program, let me know if you experience any issues with it.

WARNING : 
the program can NOT save images from now, as well as custom emojis that will be displayed using their name.
